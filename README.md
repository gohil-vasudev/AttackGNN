# AttackGNN
Supporting material for our [RL-based GNN red-teaming work](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-gohil.pdf) published at USENIX Security 2024.

The adversarial circuits generated by AttackGNN against different GNNs are in the "AttackGNN_generated_adversarial_examples/adversarial_examples_against_{GNN}" directories.


# CITATION
If you use our tool and/or adversarial circuits in your research, please cite our paper.
